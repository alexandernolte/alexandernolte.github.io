            <h4 class="my-3">What is a "hackathon"?</h4>
            <p class="text-muted">A hackathon is a short intensive event during which people come together, form teams and attempt to complete a project that is of interest to them. Teams are usually collocated, and often composed of people with diverse backgrounds, experience, and expertise. To get a more concrete idea we provided links to hackathons we co-organized here.</p>

            <p class="text-muted">This website is organized around 12 key designs decisions organizers have to make when planning a hackathon. For each decision, we provide information about who should be involved in the decision, when you should consider making it, how to make the choice and implement its result, and discuss potential tradeoffs among the various options.<ul><li>For <i>first-time organizers</i> we provide example timelines for two types of hackathons. These walk you through the different decision points and show you examples for how and why you could decide for one or the other option.</li><li><i>Experienced organizers</i> can directly access an overview of design decisions and create their own timeline for a hackathon that fits their needs.</li></ul></p>
