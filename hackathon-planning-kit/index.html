                        <p>A hackathon is a short intensive event during which people come together, form teams and attempt to complete a project that is of interest to them. Teams are usually collocated, and often composed of people with diverse backgrounds, experience, and expertise<sup>[1]</sup>. To get a more concrete idea we provided links to hackathons we co-organized <a class="js-scroll-trigger" href="#co-organized-hackathons">here</a>.</p>

                        <p>This website is organized around 12 key designs decisions organizers have to take when planning a hackathon. For each decision, we provide information about who should be involved in the decision, when you should consider making it, how to make the choice and implement its result, and discuss potential tradeoffs among the various options.</p>
                        <p>For <i>first-time organizers</i> we provide <a class="js-scroll-trigger" href="#examples">example timelines</a> for two types of hackathons. These walk you through the different decision points and show you examples for how and why you could decide for one or the other option.</p>
                        <p><i>Experienced organizers</i> can directly access an overview of <a class="js-scroll-trigger" href="#decisions">design decisions</a> and create their own timeline for a hackathon that fits their needs.</p>

Yet there is a paucity of research on corporate hackathons, which are nearly ubiquitous and present significant organizational, cultural, and managerial challenges. To provide a comprehensive understanding of team processes and broad array of outcomes of corporate hackathons, we conducted a mixed-methods, multiple case study of five teams that participated in a large scale corporate hackathon. Two teams were “pre-existing” teams (PETs) and three were newly-formed “flash” teams (FTs). Our analysis revealed that PETs coordinated almost as if it was just another day at the office while creating innovations within the boundary of their regular work, whereas FTs adopted role-based coordination adapted to the hackathon context while creating innovations beyond the boundary of their regular work. Project sustainability depended on how much effort the team put into finding a home for their projects and whether their project was a good fit with existing products in the organization’s product portfolio. Moreover, hackathon participation had perceived positive effects on participants’ skills, careers, and social networks.</p>

                                <p id="pub11abstract" class="listtoggle text-muted"><b>Abstract:</b> Time-bounded events such as hackathons have become a global phenomenon. Scientific communities in particular show growing interest in organizing them to attract newcomers and develop technical artifacts to expand their code base. Current hackathon approaches presume that participants have sufficient expertise to work on projects on their own. They only provide occasional support by domain experts serving as <i>mentors</i> which might not be sufficient for newcomers. Drawing from work on workplace and educational mentoring, we developed and evaluated an approach where each hackathon team is supported by a community member who serves in a <i>mentor</i> role that goes beyond providing occasional support. Evaluating this approach, we found that teams who took ownership of their projects, set achievable goals early while building social ties with their mentor and receiving learning-oriented support reported positive perceptions related to their project and an increased interest in the scientific community that organized the hackathon. Our work thus contributes to our understanding of mentoring in hackathons, an area which has not been extensively studied. It also proposes a feasible approach for scientific communities to attract and integrate newcomers which is crucial for their long-term survival.</p>

During these events participants typically form teams, exercise fast prototype development, challenge themselves to innovate, practice new skills, collaborate with diverse team members, and compete against other teams. Hackathon organizers have a certain vision in mind about which outcome they would like to achieve and design the event based on this vision. Participants on the other hand do not necessarily share the same vision and come with their own goals and aspirations. While work in related fields suggests that it is important for goals of organizers and participants to align in order to achieve them this might be different in hackathons due to their unique setup. Drawing from literature we identified potential goals of organizers and participants and conducted a case study of three hackathons focusing on the alignment of goals between organizers and participants. Our findings indicate that the goals of organizers and participants did not align in all cases, that goal awareness on the part of the organizers appears may have a stronger impact on goal achievement and that hackathons appear to have inherent characteristics that can materialize even when not planned for.</p>

                                <p id="pub9abstract" class="listtoggle text-muted"><b>Abstract:</b> Nowadays, hackathons have become a popular way of bringing people together to engage in brief, intensive collaborative work. Despite being a brief activity, being collocated with team members and focused on a task 'radical collocation' could improve collaboration of scientific software teams. Using a mixed-methods study of participants who attended two hackathons at Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI), we examined how hackathons can facilitate collaboration in scientific software teams which typically involve members from two different disciplines: science and software engineering. We found that hackathons created a focused interruption-free working environment in which team members were able to assess each other's skills, focus together on a single project and leverage opportunities to exchange knowledge with other collocated participants, thereby allowing technical work to advance more efficiently. This study suggests hacking" as a new and productive form of collaborative work in scientific software production.</p>

                                <p id="pub8abstract" class="listtoggle text-muted"><b>Abstract:</b> In hackathons, small teams work together over a specified period of time to complete a project of interest. Hackathons have become increasingly popular as a means to surface and prototype innovative and creative ideas for products, but their impact often goes beyond product innovation. Based on our empirical studies of 10 hackathons held by scientific communities, a corporation, and universities as well as the review of published literature, we discuss that hackathons can be organized around goals such as enriching social networks, facilitating collaborative learning, and workforce development. We also discuss design choices that can scaffold the organization of hackathons and their trade-offs. Design choices include identifying a suitable mixture of attendee skills, the selection process for projects and teams, and whether to hold a competitive or collaborative event. Hackathons can achieve multiple goals if designed carefully.</p>

Existing research, however, has mainly focused on the event itself, while potential outcomes of hackathons have received limited attention. Furthermore, most research around hackathons focuses on collegiate or civic events. Research around hackathons internal to tech companies, which are nearly ubiquitous, and present significant organizational, cultural, and managerial challenges, remains scarce. In this paper we address this gap by presenting findings from a case study of five teams which participated in a large scale corporate hackathon. Most team members voiced their intentions to continue the projects their worked on during the hackathon, but those whose projects did get continued were characterized by meticulous preparation, a focus on executing a shared vision during the hackathon, extended dissemination activities afterwards and a fit to existing product lines. Such teams were led by individuals who perceived the hackathon as an opportunity to bring their idea to life and advance their careers, and who recruited teams who had a strong interest in the idea and in learning the skills necessary to contribute efficiently. Our analysis also revealed that individual team members perceived hackathon participation to have positive effects on their career parts, networks and skill development.</p>

                                <p id="pub5abstract" class="listtoggle text-muted"><b>Abstract:</b> Mentoring is one of the most effective pedagogical tools, holding great promise for software engineering education. When done badly, however, it can lead to dysfunctional interpersonal relationships and may turn off mentees from careers in software engineering. In this qualitative interview-based study we examine how socio-technical dimensions of software impact the formation of social ties important for satisfying two goals of mentorship, building technical skill and interpersonal development. We find that mentees working on user facing, interdependent software form a balance of ties that facilitate both goals, while mentees working on non-user facing software mostly form ties important for building technical skill. Work practices that create opportunities for unstructured contact between mentees and community members, such as code review in a mentee cohort, can help to overcome this imbalance. Our findings have important implications for task definition in software engineering e-mentoring program schemes.</p>

                                <p id="pub4abstract" class="listtoggle text-muted"><b>Abstract:</b> Hackathons are events where people who are not normally collocated converge for a few days to write code together. Hackathons, it seems, are everywhere. We know that long- term collocation helps advance technical work and facilitate enduring interpersonal relationships, but can similar benefits come from brief, hackathon-style collocation? How do participants spend their time preparing, working face-to- face, and following through these brief encounters? Do the activities participants select suggest a tradeoff between the social and technical benefits of collocation? We present results from a multiple-case study that suggest the way that hackathon-style collocation advances technical work varies across technical domain, community structure, and expertise of participants. Building social ties, in contrast, seems relatively constant across hackathons. Results from different hackathon team formation strategies suggest a tradeoff between advancing technical work and building social ties. Our findings have implications for technology support that needs to be in place for hackathons and for understanding the role of brief interludes of collocation in loosely-coupled, geographically distributed work.</p>

                                <p id="pub3abstract" class="listtoggle text-muted"><b>Abstract:</b> Sharing scientific data, software, and instruments is becoming increasingly common as science moves toward large-scale, distributed collaborations. Sharing these resources requires extra work to make them generally useful. Although we know much about the extra work associated with sharing data, we know little about the work associated with sharing contributions to software, even though software is of vital importance to nearly every scientific result. This paper presents a qualitative, interview-based study of the extra work that developers and end users of scientific software undertake. Our findings indicate that they conduct a rich set of extra work around community management, code maintenance, education and training, developer-user interaction, and foreseeing user needs. We identify several conditions under which they are likely to do this work, as well as design principles that can facilitate it. Our results have important implications for future empirical studies as well as funding policy.</p>

                                <p id="pub2abstract" class="listtoggle text-muted"><b>Abstract:</b> Community code engagements, short-term, intensive software development event, are used by some scientific communities to create new software features and promote community building. But there is as yet little empirical support for their effectiveness. This paper presents a qualitative study of two types of community code engagements: Google Summer of Code (GSoC) and hackathons. We investigated the range of outcomes these engagements produce and the underlying practices that lead to these outcomes. In GSoC, the vision and experience of core members of the community influence project selection, and the intensive mentoring process facilitates creation of strong ties. Most GSoC projects result in stable features. The agenda setting phase of hackathons reveals high priority issues perceivedby the community. Social events among the relatively large numbers of participants over brief engagements tend to create weak ties. Most hackathons result in prototypes rather than finished tools. We discuss themes and tradeoffs that suggest directions for future empirical work around designing community code engagements.</p>

                                <p id="pub2abstract" class="listtoggle text-muted"><b>Abstract:</b> Scientific progress relies crucially on software, yet in practice there are significant challenges to scientific software production and maintenance. We conducted a case study of a bioinformatics software library called Biopython to investigate the promise of Google Summer of Code (GSoC), a program that pays students to work on open-source projects for the summer, for addressing these challenges. We find three positive outcomes of GSoC in the Biopython community: the addition of new features to the Biopython codebase, training, and personal development. We also find, however, that mentors face several challenges related to GSoC project selection and ranking. We believe that because GSoC provides an occasion to extend the software with capabilities that can be used to produce new knowledge, and to train successive generations of potential contributors to the software, it can play a vital role in the sustainability of open-source scientific software.</p>

Entrepreneurial hackathons in particular have gained wide spread popularity because they come with the prospect to being the grounds where the next billion dollar enterprise is born. There is however limited insight into whether and how hackathons participants and start-up founders are connected beyond studies on singular events focusing on hackathons as a starting point for start-ups. To address this gap we conducted a study on a dataset covering 44 hackathons over three years and 489 start-ups in the North-Eastern European country of Estonia. Our findings indicate that hackathons are not always the start of an entrepreneurial endeavor but can also be useful through later stages as a means to develop future products, find future employees and others. The results presented in this paper are based on an initial analysis of this rich dataset and thus present the starting point of a larger study on the connection between the hackathon and start-up communities which is currently in planning.</p>

                                <p id="workshop4abstract" class="listtoggle text-muted"><b>Abstract:</b> Based on our empirical studies of 14 hackathons held by a corporation (Microsoft OneWeek Hackathon), universities, and scientific communities including three hack days at Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI), we will present how hackathons can be designed to achieve specific goals in a semi-academic environment like STScI. Our recommendations are derived from the analysis of data collected through ethnographic observations, interviews, and questionnaires. Hackathons are not only a good way to foster innovation but also to provide learning and knowledge exchange opportunities, to create new and enhance existing social connections, to exercise new technical and leadership opportunities, and to get the needed work done or to make a quick progress on technical work. However, designing a hackathon involves careful upfront planning, project selection, team formation, goal setting, and follow-up activities. Before the hackathon, the organizers should ask potential participants to propose project ideas (e.g., highest priority needed work in the case of STScI), and elicit their skills, expertise, and project preference. The organizers should form teams by matching participants' skills to required skills for the projects. The resulting teams consist of a mix of members with varying levels of expertise. It is advisable for teams to perform preparatory work which includes appointing a team lead and having pre-event meetings where they discuss their plan for the event, break the projects into small individual tasks, assign tasks to team members, and familiarize themselves with the environment, project, and task. The organizers should advise teams to set realistic goals for the event and keep track of their progress toward these goals. At the end of the event, the organizers should advise teams to present their accomplishment and future plans, and encourage them to plan for future collaboration and designate a person to keep track of the progress. Examples include using the common free time to work side-by-side and self-organizing mini-hackathons (e.g., lunch hacks). With careful consideration of activities mentioned above, hackathons may provide a fruitful avenue of collaboration between astronomers and software experts.</p>

                                <p id="workshop3abstract" class="listtoggle text-muted"><b>Abstract:</b> Science Gateways are web portals on which data, software, instruments, and computing resources provide users, and scientists streamlined workflows through dynamically coded frontends. These web portals allow scientist to focus on research with little to no need to utilize programmatic skills. Hackathons are time-bounded events in which collaborators intensely focus on a given subject or problem in an effort to generate solutions. Hackathon events provide opportunities for participants with diverse backgrounds, mixed specialties, and broad skill sets to interact in a manner that promotes disruptive solutions. Hackathons come in a variety of different forms and serve many different purposes. These purposes include developing resources, infrastructure, practices, and culture for a community. The Science Gateways Community Institute team proposed a hackathon to introduce students attending the PEARC 2018 conference, to the concepts of Science Gateways. The aim of the hackathon was to stimulate interest in Science Gateways while developing projects that were of value to researchers from different disciplines. They believed that PEARC would be an ideal venue for this type of event, due to the community of researchers, students, and practitioners from various disciplines that were interested and skilled in the high-performance computing field attending the conference. The Science Gateways Community Institute utilized a hackathon formatted event to provide students with an opportunity to collaborate and generate targeted skills while creating needed features for production web portals. The student participants included a group of 17 graduate and undergraduate students with predominately underrepresented minorities. The hackathon followed the PEARC 2018 conference held in Pittsburgh, PA. The science gateways targeted during the event were MyGeoHub (Purdue University), Cosmic2 (San Diego Supercomputing Center), and SimCCS (Indiana University) with associated mentors serving as subject matter experts. This poster presents organizational methods and technologies used to coordinate the international planning team, lessons learned during the event, and deliverables presented by the student teams.</p>

                                <p id="workshop2abstract" class="listtoggle text-muted"><b>Abstract:</b> In hackathons, small teams work together over a specified period of time to complete a project of interest. Such time-bounded hackathon-style events have become increasingly popular across different domains in recent years. Collegiate hackathons, just one of the many variants of hackathons, that are supported by the largest hackathon league (https://mlh.io/) alone attract over 65,000 participants among more than 200 events each year. Variously known as data dives, codefests, hack-days, sprints, edit-a-thons, mapathons, and so on, such events vary depending on different audiences and with divergent aims: for example, whether teams know each other beforehand, whether the event is structured as a competition with prizes, whether the event is open or requires membership or invitations, and whether the desired outcome is primarily a product innovation, learning a new skill, forming a community around a cause, solving a technical problem that requires intensive focus by a group, or just having fun. Taken together, hackathons offer new opportunities and challenges for collaboration by affording explicit, predictable, time-bounded spaces for collaborative work and engaging with new audiences. With the goal of discussing opportunities and challenges surrounding hackathons of different kinds, this one-day workshop brought together researchers, experienced event organizers, and practitioners to share and discuss their practical experiences. Empirical insights from studying these events may help position the CHI community to better study, plan and design hackathon-style events as socio-technical systems that support new modes of production and collaboration.</p>

In 2015, collegiate hackathons alone attracted over 54,000 participants across 150 events. While hackathons", that is, competitive overnight coding events, are one of the more prevalent examples of this phenomenon, there are many more distinct event design variations for different audiences and with divergent aims: "sprints" bring together existing communities to advance planned work, "code fests" bring together related communities to encourage interoperability, "hack-days" and "hack-weeks" teach hacking and making skills to diverse audiences without software backgrounds, like artists and scientists, "edit-a-thons" support intensive co-generation of encyclopedia content, and so on. Taken together, these events offer new opportunities and challenges for cooperative work by affording explicit, predictable, time-bounded spaces for interdependent work and access to new audiences of collaborators. This one-day workshop brought together: researchers interested in the phenomenon, experienced event organizers, and participants interested in running their own events. The workshop aimed to facilitate consolidating existing research, sharing practical experiences, and understanding what benefits different event variations may offer, how they may be applied in other contexts, and how insights from studying these events may contribute to CSCW knowledge.</p>

                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">One of the main motivations for individuals to attend a hackathon is the prospect to work on an exciting project. It is thus crucial for organizers to think about how to support participants to come up with interesting and attainable project ideas they can work on during a hackathon. There is also evidence that some ideation approaches, such as traditional brainstorming, can help self-identified minorities feel more welcome and their ideas more accepted during the event [<a href="#decisionsModal8read1">1</a>].</p>

Hackathon themes are often intentionally broad covering areas such as civic technologies [<a href="#decisionsModal8read2">2</a>], environmental sustainability [<a href="#decisionsModal8read3">3</a>], entrepreneurship [<a href="#decisionsModal8read4">4</a>] and others to allow for a large variety of ideas to fit under their banner. Organizers and stakeholders can also decide to narrow the scope of potential ideas by proposing specific problems (areas) that participants should address. This approach is suitable for targeted events that e.g. aim to develop technologies for a specific community [<a href="#decisionsModal8read5">5</a>]. It is important to leave space for participants to develop ideas that are of interest to them, to ensure their motivation to participate.</p>
                                            <p class="modal-content-inline">Ideation can take place <b>before or during a hackathon</b>. For larger audiences it might be advisable to collect ideas prior to an event using technologies such as Google Docs or GitHub issues. It is important to use technologies that projected participants are familiar with. Collecting ideas through such technologies not only allows participants to describe their ideas but also enables others to comment, provide feedback and express interest. They also allow organizers and stakeholders to pre-screen ideas, adjust their ideation approach and capture ideas for future use beyond the context of a particular hackathon.</p>
                                            <p class="modal-content-inline">Conducting a separate ideation session <b>at the beginning of a hackathon</b> using common approaches [<a href="#decisionsModal8read6">6</a>] such as brainstorming [<a href="#decisionsModal8read7">7</a>] might lead to more interaction between participants, organizers and mentors and foster ideation. It also allows organizers to guide ideation by asking targeted questions [<a href="#decisionsModal8read8">8</a>] and clustering ideas e.g. based on participant interest. Ideation during a hackathon does takes away time for hacking though especially for larger audiences.</p>
                                            <p class="modal-content-inline">Collecting a <b>sufficient number of interesting ideas</b> is crucial for a successful hackathon because ideas usually form the basis for selecting teams. Collecting many <i>interesting</i> ideas is, however, not the only aspect to consider during ideation. Ideas also should be <i>attainable</i>. This means that they need to be doable during the short duration of a hackathon, that the team that attempts them has or can quickly attain the skills required to complete a project based on that idea, and that there are sufficient resources available at the hackathon, including, for example, specialized hardware, licenses, cloud resources, or others. Organizers, stakeholders and mentors can support teams to select suitable ideas and help them scope their project during the hackathon.</p>
                                            <p>Finally, it is important to consider that <b>some ideas might be extremely popular while others do not draw much attention</b>. If some ideas prove extremely popular, the idea can sometimes be split into parts, or several teams can be formed to pursue the same idea. If ideas are not popular at all it should be clear to all participants that they will not be attempted during the hackathon. Participants proposing ideas thus have to be prepared to let go of their idea and potentially join a different team and work on something else.</p>

                                                <li class="list-item"><b>Priming vs open ideation:</b> Leaving ideation completely open and in the hands of the participants can lead to them to coming up with ideas that are not, or only marginally, related to the goal of the hackathon, or with ideas that are not doable due to other constraints imposed by the setup of the event (time, specialized resources, available skills, etc.). If the primary goal is just to have fun or some basic exposure to coding and its possibilities, this may be fine. On the other hand, imposing strict limitations on the ideation process by e.g. limiting participants to address specific challenges proposed by organizers or stakeholders can in turn negatively affect the motivation of participants to attend an event and take on the proposed challenges. To address this tradeoff, it is thus advisable to always leave room for participants to develop their own ideas even when proposing challenges.</li>
                                                <li class="list-item"><b>Individual ideation vs group ideation:</b> This tradeoff is common for most creativity techniques. Asking participants to develop ideas individually and share them after ideation has ended typically leads to more diverse ideas since people tend to follow the direction of ideas that have already been proposed. Some participants might however also benefit from others sharing their ideas because it can foster their imagination. One way of dealing with this tradeoff is to take a two-step approach by asking participants to submit individual ideas prior to the hackathon and then sharing them at the beginning of the event allowing other ideas to be added. Moreover, posing multiple (potentially contradicting) ideation themes might also help participants to come up with diverse ideas.</li>
                                                <li class="list-item"><b>Time for ideation vs time to hack:</b> Conducting the ideation at the beginning of or during a hackathon provides organizers with an opportunity to steer its direction, emphasize ideas that they perceive to be best related to their goals and allows participants to develop additional related ideas. It does however also cut into the time that remains for hacking. This tradeoff becomes more problematic for larger hackathons because each participant should have the chance to propose ideas to keep the morale up which might not be possible at larger events. For larger events it is advisable to move ideation online or to ask participants to send ideas before the event.</li>
                                                <li class="list-item"><b>Too large vs too small:</b> Ideas should be interesting and challenging but at the same time doable during the short duration of a hackathon. One approach to deal with this trade-off would be to let participants propose wild ideas first that can then be scaled down to doable projects through mentoring. In order to avoid mismatched expectations, it is important for participants to be gently encouraged to be realistic in what they can hope to accomplish during an event. Prototypes where only a few example features are implemented simply, and difficult technical challenges such as analyzing substantial data sets or developing APIs are simply faked. Such compromises are common and often necessary.</li>

                                            <p class="text-muted modal-content-inline"><i>Mentoring strategy:</i> The most common strategy is for mentors to provide individual on-demand support during the hackathon based on the mentor’s expertise. In addition, organizers often set specific checkpoints during which mentors engage with teams, ask for their current progress and provide targeted feedback. It is however also possible – in particular during smaller events with few teams – to have dedicated mentors that are assigned to an individual team. Another aspect to consider is forming mentor teams with diverse backgrounds and expertise. This allows them to provide holistic feedback to participating teams. Organizers also have to decide how many mentors to recruit for their hackathon. This decision depends on the number of participating teams, the availability of mentors and other recruitment aspects we will discuss in the following. It also depends on the time of the hackathon since mentor support is mostly needed during the early and late phases of an event.</p>
                                            <p class="text-muted modal-content-inline"><i>Recruitment aspects:</i> Depending on the strategy the organizers have to decide on how to recruit suitable mentors. Common aspects for recruitment are the expertise of individuals related to the theme or domain of the event, their technical proficiency related to the technologies that participants might use during a hackathon, their prior hackathon (mentoring) experience and their ability to guide teams and support them to perform to the best of their abilities. It is also important for organizers to think about potential benefits for mentors since they will invest a lot of time and effort into mentoring.</p>
                                            <p class="text-muted modal-content-inline">After recruiting mentors, it is important for the organizers to discuss with the mentors about when and how they should engage with participating teams. This includes potential activities before the hackathon such as opening webinars as well as their availability during the event either on site or online. In the case that organizers decided for mentoring teams it also important to define those prior to the event.</p>
                                            <p class="text-muted modal-content-inline">Mentors need to be introduced to the participants either before or at the beginning of the hackathon. This introduction should include how and when participants can engage with mentors and which mentor can help them with specific topics or issues. If mentors are assigned to specific teams it is important that they do not serve as a team leader but rather provide support when needed but let the participants run their project their way.</p>
                                            <p class="text-muted modal-content-inline">How mentors engage with their teams during the hackathon largely depends on the chosen strategy. Mentors typically roam around at the hackathon site and respond to inquiries by participants and provide technical or domain related advice. It is crucial that mentors are accessible to teams when they need them e.g., through technical means like Slack. To ensure that teams take advantage of mentors, organizers can also create checkpoints during which mentors engage with teams rather than teams asking for help. Another important aspect of mentoring commonly is to help participants set expectations and scope their project so that they can reasonably complete it during the short duration of a hackathon.</p>
                                            <p class="text-muted modal-content-inline">Mentors will be particularly busy during the early and late phases of the hackathon. During the early phases teams commonly need help scoping their project and technical support to get started. During the late phases everyone is scrambling to fix last minute issues which can also lead to increased mentor demand.</p>
                                            <p class="text-muted">In some cases, mentoring can also continue after the hackathon itself has ended to e.g., complete the development and integration of a technical artifact.</p>

                                            <p class="text-muted modal-content-inline"><b>Mentor availability:</b> It is important that mentors are available to teams when they need them. The tight time constraints of a hackathon do not allow for teams to get stuck for long. It is however also important for teams to solve problems on their own. Mentors might be inclined to take over certain aspects of a project to support teams which might give an unfair advantage to those teams especially during a competitive hackathon. Moreover, mentors should be aware that they are typically not only responsible for one team. They thus need to balance their engagement with different teams. One way of achieving a suitable balance this is to create mandatory checkpoints during which mentors are available for each team and to have additional asynchronous communication channels such as Slack for teams to reach mentors when they have a specific need. The latter part is particularly important when mentors are only available online.</p>
                                            <p class="text-muted modal-content-inline"><b>Team mentor vs free flowing mentors:</b> Free flowing mentors can quickly address the needs of any team in need while team mentors can build a relationship with a team and be more effective and efficient supporting them. Supplying a larger hackathon with individual team mentors can however prove to be challenging. Moreover, being embedded as a team mentor can lead to them taking over the project from the participants which is not desirable because it negatively affects their experience and it can be unfair to other teams especially during a competitive hackathon.</p>
                                            <p class="text-muted modal-content-inline"><b>Mentor teams vs individual mentors:</b> The advantage of mentoring teams is that participants can get comprehensive support related to multiple aspects of their project (domain, technical advice, scoping, etc.). They are thus particularly useful when using checkpoints because these allow for mentors to take time to address multiple potential issues the team is facing at the same time. The advantage of mentoring teams however only materializes when the mentors in a team have different expertise. Individual mentors on the other hand can flexibly offer targeted advice for teams in need. This does however require teams to know who they should address for specific topics. Individual mentoring also makes better use of each individual mentor’s time.</p>
                                            <p class="text-muted modal-content-inline"><b>Mentor background:</b> Each mentor should at best be a domain expert with years of technical experience in the field, lots of hackathons under her/his belt and the ability to solve any problem a team might have. Since this is not possible it is important that not only participants but also the mentors are aware of the skills of other mentors to be able to refer participants to suitable mentors if needed. Mentoring teams can mitigate this issue if they are formed as discussed before.</p>
                                            <p class="text-muted modal-content-inline"><b>Participant to mentor ratio:</b> At first glance it appears that more mentors are always better since more mentors can support more teams. This is however not true in all circumstances since e.g., having many mentors that can help with domain related questions and none that can help with technical problems is not desirable. Moreover, more mentors create more organizational overhead for organizers and might result in conflicting messages to participants since different mentors might provide different advice to teams based on their personal experience and background. The more important questions organizers might want to ask themselves is which expertise might be required by participating teams at different points during a hackathon. At the beginning of an event participants will mostly require help related to scoping their project while later the required support will shift stronger towards domain and technology related questions. When deciding for mentors it is thus important to consider which expertise needs to be available to participants at which point during an event. Moreover, mentoring can also be streamlined by using the previously discussed checkpoints.</p>
                                            <p class="text-muted modal-content-inline"><b>Strict guidance vs mentors decide how to engage:</b> Each hackathon is slightly different with different goals, organizers, participants and mentoring requirements. Some organizers thus might want to provide overly strict advice to mentors related to how they should engage with their teams and when. Other organizers might just let mentors engage with teams at any point in any way they want. Both approaches are not feasible. Providing strict guidance would limit the ability – in particular of experienced mentors – to provide useful support. Providing no guidance might affect the overall structure of the hackathon. A hackathon is an intensive event during which a lot of things happen over a short period of time and mentors are crucial for an event to be successful. Spreading information about who is responsible for and knowledgeable about which topic and setting fixed checkpoints to reel everyone back in can thus help to mitigate this tradeoff.</p>
                                            <p class="text-muted"><b>Skin in the game:</b> Mentors need a motivation to participate in a hackathon since unlike teams they typically cannot win anything. It thus appears reasonable to e.g., let them propose problems or ideas that participants can solve as an incentive. This might however lead to a conflict of interest since mentors might want to focus on teams that work on the problem they proposed, and mentors might even feel inclined to take over a project they are invested in. There are multiple ways for organizers to address this issue. They can e.g., create mixed mentor teams, ask mentors to suggest problem areas that leave the specific solution open or assign mentors to teams that do not tackle the problems they proposed. At the end it should be clear that the participants decide on what they want to do and how they want to do it. Mentors are just there to support. Not to run the show.</p>
